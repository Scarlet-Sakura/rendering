        Question :
    </h1>
    <p>
        A light bulb (2.4V and 0.7A), which is approximetaly sphere-shaped with a diameter of 1cm,
        emits light equally in all directions. Find the following entities (ideal conditions are assumed).
    </p>
    <h1>
        Answer:
    </h1>
    <p>
        Ideal conditions means efficiency equal to 1. Equal in all directions means isotropic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Radiant Flux: dQ/dt = eVC = 1*2.4*0.7 = 1.68 Watt
    </p>
    <p>
        Radiant Intensity: dΦ/dw = 1.68/(4 * pi) = 0.134 W/sr
    </p>
    <p>
        Radiant Exitance: dΦ/dA = 1.68/(4 * pi * r^2) = 1.68/(4 * pi * (0.5 * 1e-2)^2) = 52.78 kW/m^2
    </p>
    <p>
        Emmited energy in five minutes is 1.68 * 300 = 504 Joule.
