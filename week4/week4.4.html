        Question - Part 1:
    </h1>
    <p>
        A 200 W spherically shaped light bulb (20% efficiency) emits red light of wavelength 650 nm equally
        in all directions. The light bulb is placed 2m above the table. Calculate the irradiance at the table.

    </p>
    <h1>
        Answer - Part 1:
    </h1>
    <p>
        Φ = ε*P = 0.2*200 = 40 Watt.
        E = Φ/A = 40/(4*pi*r^2) = 0.7957 W/m^2.
    </p>

        Question - Part 2:
    </h1>
    <p>
        Photometric quantities can be calculated from radiometric ones based on the equation:                      
    </p>
    <p>
        Photometric = Radiometric * 685 * V(λ) (1)
    </p>
    <p>In which V(λ) is the luminous efficiency curve.
        At 650nm, the luminous efficiency curve has value of 0.1. Calculate the illuminance.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Answer - Part 2:
    </h1>
    <p>
        From (1) the illuminance is : 0.7957 * 685 * 0.1 = 54.5 L/m^2.
    </p>
