        Question :
    </h1>
    <p>A small 25W light bulb has an efficiency of 20%. How many photons are approximately emitted per second?
        Assume in the calculations that we only use average photons of wavelength 500nm.</p>
    <h1>
        Answer:
    </h1>
    <p>
        number of photons emitted per second = (power of light bulb in watts)/(energy of a photon in Joules) (1)
    </p>
    <p>
        because the efficiency is 20% only 5 Watts of the 25 in total wwill be converted into visible light.
    </p>
    <p>
        for the average photons the energy is hf = 4*1e-19 Joule.
    </p>
    <p>
        from (1) we have 5/(4*1e-19) = 1.25*1e19 photons per second.
    </p>
