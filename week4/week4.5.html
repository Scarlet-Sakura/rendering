        Question :
    </h1>
    <p>
        In a simple arrangement the luminous intensity of an uknown light source is determined 
        from a known light source. The light sourcs are placed 1 m from each other and illuminate 
        a double sided screen placed between light sources. The screen is moved until both sides
        are equally illuminated as observed by a photometer. At the position of match, the screen 
        is 35 cm from the known source with luminous intensity Is = 40 lm/sr = 40 cd
        and 65 cm from the uknown light source. What is the luminous intensity Ix of the uknown source?

        Answer :
    </h1>
    <p>
        The sources are equally illuminated:
    </p>
    <p>
        E1 = E2 -> Is / r1^2 = Ix / r2^2 -> Ix = Is * (r2/r1)^2 -> Ix = 137.96 lm/sr or cd.
