        Question :
    </h1>
    <p>
       The radiance L from a diffuse light source (emmitter) of 10 x 10 cm is 5000 W/(sr m^2).
       Calculate the radiosity (radiant exitance). How much energy is emmited from the light source?
    </p>
    <h1>
        Answer :
    </h1>
    <p>
        Radiant Exitance : M = L*pi = 15708 W/m^2.
    </p>

    <p>
        Energy emitted from the light source : E = M * A = 15708 * 0.01 = 157.08 Watt.
